# Decksy AI Delivery Plan (Update)

## Recently Completed
- Removed premium references and Stripe dependencies from the product, backend, and developer docs so the experience reflects a free tier only.
- Shipped illustrated card grids on recommendation and deck detail views, including responsive spacing fixes to match the reported layout gaps.
- Refined the Gemini explainer prompt to avoid personal names, enforce tone/structure guidance, and added Vitest coverage for the prompt parser/builder.
- Addressed Next.js build warnings by simplifying fetch caching directives and refreshed internal guidance across `.github/` docs.

## In Flight / Next Up
1. **Card art sourcing:** Download and optimise official Clash Royale card imagery (document licensing) to replace the temporary RoyaleAPI links and ensure offline availability.
2. **UI QA sweep:** Capture responsive screenshots of the updated deck recommendation and detail layouts and validate accessibility (focus order, colour contrast) after the spacing overhaul.
3. **Security follow-up:** Resolve the `npm audit` critical vulnerability and document the remediation path so production deploys are unblocked.
4. **Prompt regression coverage:** Extend Vitest coverage to the Gemini fallback explainer and cache key helpers to guard against future refactors.
5. **History polish:** Introduce deck imagery to the history list and consider surfacing quick links for recently viewed decks once the asset pipeline is ready.
