# Decksy AI Delivery Plan (Update)

## Recently Completed
- Stood up dedicated account, login, privacy, and terms routes so every top-level navigation destination resolves with on-brand placeholders.
- Tightened the recommendation results grid, introducing a sticky feedback panel to remove the dangling column gap on wide screens.
- Removed premium references and Stripe dependencies from the product, backend, and developer docs so the experience reflects a free tier only.
- Shipped illustrated card grids on recommendation and deck detail views, including responsive spacing fixes to match the reported layout gaps.
- Refined the Gemini explainer prompt to avoid personal names, enforce tone/structure guidance, and added Vitest coverage for the prompt parser/builder.
- Addressed Next.js build warnings by simplifying fetch caching directives and refreshed internal guidance across `.github/` docs.
- Shipped production-grade authentication with Auth.js (magic links + GitHub), Prisma persistence, audit logging, and a full account dashboard with profile sync and session revocation.

## In Flight / Next Up
1. **Card art sourcing:** Download and optimise official Clash Royale card imagery (document licensing) to replace the temporary RoyaleAPI links and ensure offline availability.
2. **Accessibility validation:** Run an axe scan across core flows (home → recommend → deck detail) now that authentication flows are live and note any remediations.
3. **Security follow-up:** Resolve the `npm audit` critical vulnerability, add dependency scanning to CI, and document the remediation path so production deploys are unblocked.
4. **Prompt regression coverage:** Extend Vitest coverage to the Gemini fallback explainer and cache key helpers to guard against future refactors.
5. **Analytics & monitoring:** Wire PostHog and Sentry to capture key product funnels and critical API errors before launch.
