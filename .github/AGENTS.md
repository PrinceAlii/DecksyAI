# Decksy AI Repository Agent Guidelines

- This `.github` directory is ignored in version control except for documentation like this file.
- Do **not** place automation workflows or configuration files in this folder; it is reserved for meta-instructions for repository agents.
- PR descriptions should summarize key code or configuration changes and list any tests run.
