# DECK-104c: Public Deck Sharing - COMPLETE ✅

## Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented the Public Deck Sharing feature that allows users to make their decks public, share them via URLs, and track views and copies. Other users can discover, view, and copy public decks to their own collections.

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. **prisma/schema.prisma** (MODIFIED)
Added tracking fields to CustomDeck model:

**New Fields:**
- `viewCount Int @default(0)` - Track public deck views
- `copyCount Int @default(0)` - Track how many times deck was copied

**New Indexes:**
- `@@index([isPublic, createdAt])` - For browsing public decks by date
- `@@index([isPublic, viewCount])` - For sorting by popularity

### 2. **prisma/migrations/20251018_add_public_deck_tracking/migration.sql** (NEW)
Database migration to add new fields and indexes:
- Adds viewCount and copyCount columns with default 0
- Creates composite indexes for efficient public deck queries
- Safe migration (no data loss)

### 3. **src/app/deck/[userId]/[slug]/page.tsx** (NEW - 135 lines)
Server-side page for viewing public decks:

**Features:**
- Dynamic route: `/deck/[userId]/[slug]`
- Fetches deck with user information (name, image)
- Privacy check: Only shows public decks or owner's own decks
- Increments view count (only for non-owners)
- Generates OG meta tags for social sharing
- Server-side rendering for SEO

**Metadata:**
- Title: `{deckName} | Decksy AI`
- Description: Custom or fallback
- OpenGraph tags for Twitter/Facebook
- Large image card for social previews

### 4. **src/components/features/deck-builder/public-deck-view.tsx** (NEW - 351 lines)
Beautiful public deck viewing component:

**UI Sections:**
- **Header**:
  - Back button
  - Deck name with archetype badge
  - Description
  - Creator name, view count, copy count, creation date
  - Share button (native share API with clipboard fallback)
  - Copy Deck button (primary CTA)
  - Edit button (owner only)

- **Deck Display**:
  - 4x2 card grid with hover effects
  - Average elixir cost
  - Card count indicator

- **AI Analysis** (if available):
  - Displays stored analysis results
  - Styled card with accent colors

- **Call to Action**:
  - Encourages copying deck
  - Gradient background
  - Primary button

**Features:**
- Copy deck functionality with authentication check
- Redirect to login if not authenticated
- Share via Web Share API or clipboard
- Visual feedback for actions
- Responsive layout

### 5. **src/app/api/deck/custom/copy/route.ts** (NEW - 130 lines)
API endpoint for copying public decks:

**Request:** POST `/api/deck/custom/copy`
```json
{
  "deckId": "string",
  "userId": "string",
  "slug": "string"
}
```

**Response:** 201 Created
```json
{
  "deck": { ...copiedDeck },
  "message": "Deck copied successfully!"
}
```

**Logic:**
1. Verify user is authenticated
2. Fetch source deck
3. Check deck is public or owned by user
4. Prevent copying own deck
5. Generate unique slug: `{name}-copy-{timestamp}`
6. Create new deck with copied data
7. Increment copy count on source
8. Return new deck

**Error Handling:**
- 401: Not authenticated
- 403: Deck is private
- 404: Deck not found
- 400: Cannot copy own deck

### 6. **src/app/api/deck/custom/route.ts** (MODIFIED)
Updated GET endpoint to include new fields:

**Changes:**
- Added `viewCount: true` to select
- Added `copyCount: true` to select

### 7. **src/components/features/account/saved-deck-card.tsx** (MODIFIED - 282 lines)
Enhanced deck card with public sharing controls:

**New Props:**
- `userId?: string` - For generating public URLs
- `isPublic?: boolean` - Deck visibility status
- `viewCount?: number` - Public view count
- `copyCount?: number` - Copy count
- `onTogglePublic?: (deck, isPublic) => void` - Toggle handler

**New UI Elements:**
- **Public Badge**: Shows "Public" with Globe icon
- **View Count**: Shows eye icon + count when > 0
- **Copy Count**: Shows copy icon + count when > 0
- **Public/Private Toggle Button**:
  - Globe icon when public
  - Lock icon when private
  - Toggles deck visibility
- **Copy Link Button**: Copies public URL to clipboard

**Visual Design:**
- Badges use accent colors for public status
- Icons inline with metadata
- Hover states on toggle buttons
- Feedback animations (check mark on copy)

### 8. **src/components/features/account/saved-decks-client.tsx** (MODIFIED)
Updated to handle public deck features:

**New Props:**
- `userId: string` - Required prop from parent

**New State:**
- Deck interface includes `isPublic`, `viewCount`, `copyCount`

**New Handler:**
```typescript
handleTogglePublic(deck: SavedDeck, isPublic: boolean)
```
- Calls PATCH `/api/deck/custom`
- Updates local state optimistically
- Shows error on failure

**Changes:**
- Passes `userId` to SavedDeckCard
- Passes `onTogglePublic` handler
- Updates deck interface with new fields

### 9. **src/app/account/decks/page.tsx** (MODIFIED)
Updated to fetch session and pass userId:

**Changes:**
- Made async server component
- Fetches session with `getServerAuthSession()`
- Redirects to login if not authenticated
- Passes `userId` to SavedDecksClient

## Technical Details

### URL Structure
Public deck URLs follow pattern:
```
/deck/[userId]/[slug]
```

Example:
```
/deck/cm1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0/hog-cycle-deck
```

### View Tracking
- Views incremented server-side
- Only counts non-owner views
- Atomic increment (no race conditions)
- No double-counting on refresh

### Copy Tracking
- Increments on successful copy
- Atomic operation
- Persists across sessions

### Privacy Model
- Decks private by default
- Owner can toggle public/private
- Public decks have unique URLs
- Private decks return 403 for non-owners

### Social Sharing
**Web Share API:**
- Native share on mobile
- Shares: title, description, URL

**Fallback:**
- Clipboard copy
- Visual feedback
- Works on all browsers

**OG Tags:**
- OpenGraph for Facebook/LinkedIn
- Twitter Card for Twitter
- Large image format
- Custom descriptions

## User Flows

### Flow 1: Make Deck Public & Share
1. User creates/saves deck
2. Clicks "Private" button on deck card
3. Button changes to "Public" with Globe icon
4. Public badge appears in metadata
5. Copy link button appears
6. User clicks copy link button
7. URL copied to clipboard
8. User shares link via social media/messaging

### Flow 2: View Public Deck
1. User receives/clicks public deck link
2. Page loads with deck information
3. View count increments (if not owner)
4. User sees:
   - Deck cards in 4x2 grid
   - Creator name
   - View and copy counts
   - AI analysis (if available)
5. User clicks "Copy Deck"
6. Redirects to login (if not authenticated)
7. Deck copied to user's collection
8. Copy count increments
9. Redirects to deck builder with copied deck

### Flow 3: Owner Views Own Public Deck
1. Owner clicks public link to their deck
2. Page loads normally
3. View count does NOT increment
4. "Edit" button shown instead of "Copy Deck"
5. Can click Edit to open in deck builder

## Security & Privacy

### Access Control
- Public decks: Anyone with link
- Private decks: Owner only
- Copy requires authentication

### Rate Limiting
- Not yet implemented (TODO)
- Recommended: 10 views/minute per IP
- Recommended: 5 copies/hour per user

### Validation
- Zod schemas validate all inputs
- User ownership verified before updates
- Slug/userId combination prevents conflicts

## Performance Considerations

### Database Indexes
- `(isPublic, createdAt)`: Fast browsing by date
- `(isPublic, viewCount)`: Fast sorting by popularity
- Both indexes support community browser (DECK-104d)

### Caching Opportunities (Future)
- Redis cache public decks (5 min TTL)
- CDN for card images
- Static generation for popular decks

## Future Enhancements (Out of Scope)

- [ ] Rate limiting on views/copies
- [ ] Dynamic OG image generation (deck preview)
- [ ] Deck comments/ratings
- [ ] Share to specific platforms (Twitter, Discord)
- [ ] QR code generation for deck URLs
- [ ] Deck embedding (iframe)
- [ ] Analytics dashboard for deck creators
- [ ] Popular/trending decks page

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Database migration created
- [x] Prisma schema updated
- [x] API endpoints created
