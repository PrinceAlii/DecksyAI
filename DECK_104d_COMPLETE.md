## Technical Details

### Database Queries

**Efficient Filtering:**
```typescript
where: {
  isPublic: true,
  name: { contains: search, mode: "insensitive" }, // Full-text search
  cards: { array_contains: [cardKey] } // JSON array filter
}
```

**Optimized Sorting:**
- `sortBy: "newest"` → `orderBy: { createdAt: "desc" }`
- `sortBy: "views"` → `orderBy: { viewCount: "desc" }`
- `sortBy: "copies"` → `orderBy: { copyCount: "desc" }`

**Pagination:**
```typescript
skip: (page - 1) * limit
take: limit
```

**Parallel Queries:**
```typescript
Promise.all([
  prisma.customDeck.findMany(...), // Fetch decks
  prisma.customDeck.count(...)     // Count total
])
```

### URL State Management

**Query Parameter Sync:**
- Filters automatically update URL
- URL updates trigger data fetch
- Browser history preserved
- Deep linking supported

**Example URLs:**
```
/decks/browse                                    # Default view
/decks/browse?page=2                            # Page 2
/decks/browse?sortBy=views                      # Most viewed
/decks/browse?search=hog&archetype=Cycle        # Search + filter
/decks/browse?page=3&sortBy=copies&archetype=Log+Bait  # Complex
```

### Responsive Design

**Breakpoints:**
- Mobile: 1 column
- Tablet (sm): 2 columns
- Desktop (lg): 3 columns

**Touch-Friendly:**
- Large tap targets (buttons 44px min)
- Swipe-friendly cards
- Bottom-safe spacing on mobile

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Debounced Search:** Search triggers on form submit (Enter key)
2. **Image Loading:** Lazy loading with unoptimized flag for CDN
3. **Parallel Queries:** Count and fetch happen simultaneously
4. **Pagination:** Only load 20 decks per page
5. **Smart Re-fetching:** Only fetch on URL change
6. **Error Boundaries:** Graceful error handling
