# Fixes Applied - October 17, 2025

## Issues Resolved

### 1. ✅ React Hooks Called Conditionally
**Problem:** In `recommendation-results.tsx`, React hooks were being called after an early return statement, violating the Rules of Hooks.

**Error:**
```
React Hook "useState" is called conditionally. React Hooks must be called in the exact same order in every component render.
```

**Solution:** Moved all hook declarations (useState, useRouter) to the top of the component, before any conditional returns.

**File Changed:** `src/components/features/recommendation-results.tsx`

---

### 2. ✅ Zod Schema Validation Errors
**Problem:** The `recommendationPayloadSchema` was incomplete and didn't match the TypeScript `RecommendationPayload` interface, causing validation failures when optional fields were present.

**Error:**
```javascript
{
  code: 'invalid_type',
  expected: 'string',
  received: 'undefined',
  path: [...],
  message: 'Required'
}
```

**Solution:** Updated the Zod schema to include all optional fields:
- `userId?: string`
- `sessionId?: string` 
- `feedbackPreferences?: { ... }`
- `battleAggregate?: { ... }`
- `weightVariantOverride?: string`

**File Changed:** `src/app/api/_schemas.ts`

---

### 3. ⚠️ Database Schema Mismatch (User.name column)
**Problem:** The database is missing the `User.name` column that NextAuth expects, even though it exists in the Prisma schema.

**Error:**
```
PrismaClientKnownRequestError: 
Invalid `prisma.user.findUnique()` invocation:
The column `User.name` does not exist in the current database.
```

**Root Cause:** The database was not properly migrated or the migrations were not applied in the correct order.

**Solution Options:**

#### Option A: Manual SQL (Safest for production data)
Run the provided SQL script `fix-database.sql`:
```bash
# Using psql or your database client
psql $DATABASE_URL -f fix-database.sql
```

#### Option B: Prisma DB Push (Development only - may lose data)
```bash
npx prisma db push --accept-data-loss
```

#### Option C: Reset and Re-migrate (Development only - WILL lose all data)
```bash
npx prisma migrate reset --force
```

**Files Created:**
- `fix-database.sql` - Safe SQL script to add missing column

---

### 4. ✅ Player Tag Validation Length
**Problem:** Player tags were required to be at least 8 characters, but valid tags can be 7 characters (e.g., "2L2098J").

**Solution:** Updated the minimum length from 8 to 7 characters.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/lib/player-tag.ts` - Updated `MIN_PLAYER_TAG_LENGTH = 7`
- Updated validation message to reflect correct minimum

---

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Run `npm run build` to verify TypeScript compilation
- [ ] Run database migration/fix for `User.name` column
- [ ] Test player tag input with 7-character tags (e.g., "2L2098J")
- [ ] Test recommendation flow with "Fetch my data"
- [ ] Test account creation via email
- [ ] Verify no React Hooks errors in console
- [ ] Verify no Zod validation errors when fetching player data

# Additional Fixes - October 18, 2025

## Issues Resolved

### 5. ✅ Redis TLS Certificate Error
**Problem:** Heroku Redis connection failing with self-signed certificate error.

**Error:**
```
[ioredis] Unhandled error event: Error: self-signed certificate in certificate chain
```

**Root Cause:** Heroku Redis uses self-signed TLS certificates by design. The code was attempting strict certificate verification which failed with Heroku's certificates.

**Solution:** Updated `src/lib/redis.ts` to:
1. Always use `rejectUnauthorized: false` for `rediss://` connections (Heroku standard practice)
2. Added proper error event handler to prevent unhandled errors from crashing the app
3. Simplified TLS logic - encryption remains active, just without strict cert verification

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// src/lib/redis.ts
if (isTls) {
  // Heroku Redis uses self-signed certificates, so we need to disable strict verification
  // This is safe because the connection is still encrypted
  (redisOptions as any).tls = {
    rejectUnauthorized: false,
  };
}

client = new Redis(REDIS_URL, redisOptions as any);

// Handle connection errors to prevent unhandled error events
client.on("error", (err) => {
  console.error("[redis] Connection error:", err.message);
  // Don't crash the app, just log and continue
});
```

**Files Changed:** `src/lib/redis.ts`

---

### 6. ✅ Catalog Lint Failures
**Problem:** Multiple validation failures in deck catalog:
- 13 decks with trophy ranges exceeding max (10000)
- 5 missing card elixir cost mappings
- 19 decks with incorrect average elixir calculations

**Errors:**
```
Trophy range [5500, 10500] invalid (max: 10000)
Card 'princess' not found in elixir cost map
Average elixir mismatch: expected 3.0, got 3.3
```

**Solutions:**

#### A. Added Missing Card Elixir Costs
Added 5 cards to `src/lib/data/card-elixir.ts`:
```typescript
princess: 3,
wizard: 5,
little_prince: 3,
mirror: 0, // Variable cost
spear_goblins: 2,
```

#### B. Fixed Trophy Ranges (Capped at 10000)
Corrected 13 decks with invalid ranges:
- `[5500, 10500]` → `[5500, 10000]`
- `[5600, 10800]` → `[5600, 10000]`
- `[5400, 10300]` → `[5400, 10000]`
- And 10 more decks

#### C. Recalculated Average Elixir
Fixed 19 decks with elixir mismatches:
- evo-skeletons-logbait: 3.3 → 3.0
- evo-mortar-cycle: 2.7 → 2.6
- little-prince-mighty-miner-cycle: 3.1 → 2.8
- electro-giant-mother-witch: 4.0 → 3.5
- miner-wallbreakers-bait: 3.2 → 2.9
- evo-firecracker-goblin-giant: 3.7 → 3.8
- Plus 13 additional decks

**Final Validation Result:**
```bash
$ npm run catalog:lint
✅ Deck catalog lint passed for 50 decks. 
Archetype coverage: beatdown=16, control=11, cycle=8, siege=3, spell=1, tempo=11.
```

**Files Changed:** 
- `src/lib/data/card-elixir.ts`
- `src/lib/data/deck-catalog.ts`

---

### 7. ✅ Domain Reference Updates
**Problem:** Application contained references to old domain `decksy.ai` instead of production domain `decksy.dev`.

**Solution:** Updated all domain references across the codebase:
- Email configuration (login@decksy.dev, support@decksy.dev)
- Metadata base URLs
- NextAuth configuration
- Documentation

**Files Changed:**
- `src/lib/auth.ts`
- `src/lib/env.ts`
- `src/app/layout.tsx`
- `src/app/login/page.tsx`
- `src/app/terms/page.tsx`
- `src/app/privacy/page.tsx`
- `.env.example`
- `README.md`
- `DEPLOYMENT_FIX.md`

**Heroku Config Var Set:**
```bash
heroku config:set NEXTAUTH_URL=https://decksy.dev -a decksy-ai-prod
```

---

4. **Test locally**: `npm run dev`
5. **Deploy to Heroku** once all tests pass

---

## Files Modified

1. `src/components/features/recommendation-results.tsx` - Fixed React Hooks ordering
2. `src/app/api/_schemas.ts` - Enhanced Zod validation schema
3. `src/lib/player-tag.ts` - Updated minimum tag length
4. `fix-database.sql` - Created SQL fix script

---

## Notes

- The middleware rate limiting has been disabled (from previous fix) because `ioredis` doesn't work in Edge Runtime
- All TypeScript compilation errors should now be resolved
- The database schema issue requires manual intervention since automated tools were hanging
