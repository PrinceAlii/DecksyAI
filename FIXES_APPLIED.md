# Fixes Applied - October 17, 2025

## Issues Resolved

### 1. ✅ React Hooks Called Conditionally
**Problem:** In `recommendation-results.tsx`, React hooks were being called after an early return statement, violating the Rules of Hooks.

**Error:**
```
React Hook "useState" is called conditionally. React Hooks must be called in the exact same order in every component render.
```

**Solution:** Moved all hook declarations (useState, useRouter) to the top of the component, before any conditional returns.

**File Changed:** `src/components/features/recommendation-results.tsx`

---

### 2. ✅ Zod Schema Validation Errors
**Problem:** The `recommendationPayloadSchema` was incomplete and didn't match the TypeScript `RecommendationPayload` interface, causing validation failures when optional fields were present.

**Error:**
```javascript
{
  code: 'invalid_type',
  expected: 'string',
  received: 'undefined',
  path: [...],
  message: 'Required'
}
```

**Solution:** Updated the Zod schema to include all optional fields:
- `userId?: string`
- `sessionId?: string` 
- `feedbackPreferences?: { ... }`
- `battleAggregate?: { ... }`
- `weightVariantOverride?: string`

**File Changed:** `src/app/api/_schemas.ts`

---

### 3. ⚠️ Database Schema Mismatch (User.name column)
**Problem:** The database is missing the `User.name` column that NextAuth expects, even though it exists in the Prisma schema.

**Error:**
```
PrismaClientKnownRequestError: 
Invalid `prisma.user.findUnique()` invocation:
The column `User.name` does not exist in the current database.
```

**Root Cause:** The database was not properly migrated or the migrations were not applied in the correct order.

**Solution Options:**

#### Option A: Manual SQL (Safest for production data)
Run the provided SQL script `fix-database.sql`:
```bash
# Using psql or your database client
psql $DATABASE_URL -f fix-database.sql
```

#### Option B: Prisma DB Push (Development only - may lose data)
```bash
npx prisma db push --accept-data-loss
```

#### Option C: Reset and Re-migrate (Development only - WILL lose all data)
```bash
npx prisma migrate reset --force
```

**Files Created:**
- `fix-database.sql` - Safe SQL script to add missing column

---

### 4. ✅ Player Tag Validation Length
**Problem:** Player tags were required to be at least 8 characters, but valid tags can be 7 characters (e.g., "2L2098J").

**Solution:** Updated the minimum length from 8 to 7 characters.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/lib/player-tag.ts` - Updated `MIN_PLAYER_TAG_LENGTH = 7`
- Updated validation message to reflect correct minimum

---

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Run `npm run build` to verify TypeScript compilation
- [ ] Run database migration/fix for `User.name` column
- [ ] Test player tag input with 7-character tags (e.g., "2L2098J")
- [ ] Test recommendation flow with "Fetch my data"
- [ ] Test account creation via email
- [ ] Verify no React Hooks errors in console
- [ ] Verify no Zod validation errors when fetching player data

---

## Next Steps

1. **Apply database fix** using one of the options above
2. **Regenerate Prisma Client**: `npx prisma generate`
3. **Run build**: `npm run build`
4. **Test locally**: `npm run dev`
5. **Deploy to Heroku** once all tests pass

---

## Files Modified

1. `src/components/features/recommendation-results.tsx` - Fixed React Hooks ordering
2. `src/app/api/_schemas.ts` - Enhanced Zod validation schema
3. `src/lib/player-tag.ts` - Updated minimum tag length
4. `fix-database.sql` - Created SQL fix script

---

## Notes

- The middleware rate limiting has been disabled (from previous fix) because `ioredis` doesn't work in Edge Runtime
- All TypeScript compilation errors should now be resolved
- The database schema issue requires manual intervention since automated tools were hanging
