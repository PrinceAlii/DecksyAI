This folder contains site assets used at runtime by the web server.

Current favicons:
- `logo.svg` - the primary SVG logo used as the site icon (newly generated by Copilot).
- `favicon-32.png` - placeholder PNG (replace with a 32x32 PNG exported from your design tool).
- `favicon-16.png` - placeholder PNG (replace with a 16x16 PNG exported from your design tool).

To replace the PNG placeholders, export PNGs at the exact sizes and overwrite the files above. Browsers that don't support SVG favicons will use the PNG files instead.

If you want a favicon.ico file (multi-size), you can generate one from the PNGs with a tool like imagemagick:

    convert favicon-32.png favicon-16.png -colors 256 favicon.ico

Or use an online favicon generator to get multiple sizes.
