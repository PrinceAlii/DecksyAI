- **Caching:** Browser caching for static assets

### Expected Metrics
- Page load: <2s
- Filter update: <500ms
- Pagination: <300ms
- Modal open: <100ms

---

## Security & Privacy

### Access Control
- Public decks: Anyone with link

- Atomic view/copy increments (no race conditions)
- Input validation with Zod schemas

### Rate Limiting (Recommended)
- 10 views/minute per IP
- 5 copies/hour per user
- 20 searches/minute per user

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (Recommended)
- Comparison logic (deck-comparison.ts)
- Upgrade calculator (upgrade-calculator.ts)
- Priority algorithm
- Formatting utilities

### Integration Tests (Recommended)
- API endpoints with mocked Prisma
- Copy deck flow
- View count increment
- Search and filter combinations

### E2E Tests (Recommended)
- Complete browse → view → copy flow

- Comparison selection and display
- Upgrade calculator opens and displays
- Pagination navigation

### Manual Testing Completed
- ✅ All modals open and close
- ✅ Buttons trigger correct actions
- ✅ State updates correctly

## Known Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **Archetype filtering:** UI ready, but archetypes not stored in DB (computed on-the-fly)
2. **Card filtering:** Requires card data integration
3. **Rate limiting:** Not yet implemented
4. **OG images:** Using placeholder, needs dynamic generator
5. **Prisma client:** Requires regeneration after migration

### Future Database Needs
- Add `archetype` field to CustomDeck (denormalized)
- Add `DeckRating` model for ratings
- Add `DeckComment` model for comments
- Add `DeckFavorite` model for bookmarks
